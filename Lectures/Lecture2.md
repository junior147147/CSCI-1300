What is a computer?
-------------------
* Storage : the file system is permanent storage for programs and data (Incrediblely slow)

* I/O : input -> process -> output
	- keyboard
	- mouse
	- display

* Memory : Programs you write are loaded into memory (super FAST but limited)
	- Memory has address with corresponding data (value)
	- Each data type requires different memory


* CPU : Executae machine codes (source code -> compiler -> machine code)

 Counting
 -----------

	- Decimal : 42  
		- How PC runs it : (1*2)+(10*4)= 2 + 40 = 42
	- Binary : 101010
		- how PC runs it : (1*2) + (1*8) + (1*32) = 2 + 8 + 32 = 42
	- Hexadecimal : 0x
		- find out how to find 42 in Hex.

	- why using Binary?
		- easy to represent states, on and off

Jokes
------
* There are 10 type of people in the world, the one knows binary and the one don't

Terminology
-------------
* program
	- writting source code in text form

* difference syntax , same sematics : different Programming language 

* syntax
	- the rules of language
* semantics
	- what does the program supposed to do , meaning (on top of syntax)
* Syntax errors 
	- vilading the rule of a langauge
