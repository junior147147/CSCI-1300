What is a computer?
-------------------
* **Storage** : the file system is permanent storage for programs and data (Incredibly slow)

* **I/O** : input -> process -> output
	- keyboard
	- mouse
	- display

* **Memory** : Programs you write are loaded into memory (super FAST but limited)
	- Memory has address with corresponding data (value)
	- Each data type requires different memory


* **CPU** : Execute machine codes (source code -> compiler -> machine code)

 Counting
 -----------

	- **Decimal** : 42  
		- How PC runs it : (1*2)+(10*4)= 2 + 40 = 42
	- **Binary** : 101010
		- how PC runs it : (1*2) + (1*8) + (1*32) = 2 + 8 + 32 = 42
	- **Hexadecimal** : 0x
		- find out how to find 42 in Hex.

	- why using Binary?
		- easy to represent states, on and off

Jokes
------
* There are 10 type of people in the world, the one knows binary and the one don't

Terminology
-------------
* **Program**
	- writing source code in text form

* Difference syntax , same semantics : different Programming language 

* **Syntax**
	- the rules of language
* **Semantics**
	- what does the program supposed to do , meaning (on top of syntax)
* **Syntax errors** 
	- violating the rule of a language
